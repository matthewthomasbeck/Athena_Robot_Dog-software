Project Athena!

CREATOR(s):

Hi, my name is Matthew Beck, and I am responsible for writing specifically the code for this robot dog. Other extremely
important contributors to this project as a whole are Omar Ferrer, a fellow software engineer who helped me create the
environment (wouldn't have been able to do it without him) that allowed me to do this in the first place, and Aaed Musa,
the mechanical engineer responsible fot the Ares robotic dog platform, which has given me the luxury to focus on
software and not engineering.

PURPOSE:

Software Engineering has an uneasy future ahead of it, and I wanted to make sure I had sharp skills in a way that
ensured said stills wouldn't immediately be replaced by A.I. (my thought process being that though it's not impossible
for a roboticist to be replaced by A.I., it's probably going to be a lot harder to replace me as compared to if I chose
to make apps and whatnot; sorry if I am accidentally throwing shade to some people, it's just what I think may happen).

This robot dog is meant to provide me a stepping stone of which I can move onto other projects such as:

* more advanced ML models
* controlling the robot via the internet
* more advanced robots

Hopefully these things pan out, we'll see.

HOW YOU CAN HELP:

If you like it, STAR IT!!! I am a uni student right now, but I've got to start preparing for either a master's program
or to get hired, and so any help would mean the world.
